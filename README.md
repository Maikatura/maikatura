I am a Game Developer that has great knowledge in C# and just basic understanding of C++.
I mostly play MMORPGs and if I dont work or play World of Warcraft I sometimes, but just sometimes play VRChat.
<br><br>
My Dream is to release my own 3D MMORPG that isn't P2W or just bombarded with microtransactions.
My dream after that would be to make a really good network solution for C++ developers for free.
